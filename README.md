# Web Scraper Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 11

# Mars News and Weather Scraping
This repository consists of two main components:

* Primary Jupyter Notebook (Section 1 - mars_news.ipynb): This notebook includes the intial demonstration of web scraping using a site focusing on Mars news article titles and sections. It uses Python's libraries, Splinter and BS4 (BeautifulSoup) to scrape through the site and extract the requested data.

* Secondary Jupyter Notebook (Section 2 - mars_weather.ipynb): This notebook serves as a web scraper and data analysis tool for a site containing a table covering temperature data on Mars. It uses Python's libraries, Splinter and BS4 (BeautifulSoup) to scrape through the site and extract the requested data. It then uses Pandas to clean and analyze the data, and Matplotlib to visualize the data.
